In this coding challenge we have provided you with a very basic sign-up form that collects some information form the users. Your task is to add validation to the form to improve the user experience.

You need to make sure that:

The first name is not empty.
The last name is not empty.
Email is a valid email address.
Password is at least 8 characters long.
Confirm password field has the same value as the password.
Match the above conditions to relevant error messages in Example section and display them below the relevant input fields.

You should update the handleSubmit method to show the alert only if all of the input values are accepted, alternatively display only the relevant error messages.

Errors should be displayed only after the user has pressed the Sing Up button, if there are no errors call console.log(’Form submitted successfully’).
