Write a custom hook called useTheme that holds the current value of the theme which can be either “light” or “dark”. The hook should be able to store and manage the information on whether the page should be using light or dark mode. It should return an object with two properties. Please see the example below for the required return object.

We have already written some starting code for you.

Directions
Use strings light and dark to track the current theme.
The default theme should be light.
You do not need to edit the App component. Tests will be scoring only the useTheme hook.
